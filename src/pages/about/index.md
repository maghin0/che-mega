### About the Unit

The electronic microscope and molecular imaging unit at Mansoura University is a unit of a special nature located in the "and" building of the Faculty of Agriculture, and it was inaugurated on 3/10/2013 at a cost of about 7 million pounds, to be considered the most recent unit at the level of Egyptian universities, which serves scientific research at the university and outside it as well Industrial institutions in Egypt and the Arab region in various fields include nanotechnology, physics, materials science, and semiconductors, in addition to biological sciences in its various branches such as the science of studying microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, and various tissue cells in the faculties of agriculture, medicine, science, veterinary medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy.

The unit includes two main devices, one of which is the SEM electron microscope to photograph the samples tested from the surface and gives high-quality and clear stereoscopic images. It can work under vacuum and used in all physical, biological, industrial applications, mining, soil analysis, raw materials and crystallography as well as plant and animal tissues. It is provided with an element analysis device using X-rays. Which allows to make a comparison between the proportions of the elements in the sample with the illustration, and the second is the TEM electron microscope. To photograph the samples from the inside with a magnification of one and a half million times, which enables the researcher to examine the details of the sample with high accuracy, as well as 20 complementary devices for the basic microscope. In addition to the Zeta Analyzer device, which is used to measure the size of the particles, their weight, the electrical charge on them from abroad, and the rheological properties. This is useful in drug research in the pharmacy faculties and in the fields of engineering, science and agriculture.

The unit performs its services to all researchers in various specialties in scientific colleges, research centers and industrial institutions.
